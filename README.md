# bassics

bassics is a typesafe reactive frontend microframework for building high-performance client apps with familiar patterns like central state management, actions + reducers, html templates, and routing.

Well, it will be. **It's not ready for use yet.** Hopefully version 0.1.0 will be published soon.

## TODO

- [ ] Extract from existing project
- [ ] Stop passing the store around
- [ ] Document example app
- [ ] Include render action
- [ ] Routing?
